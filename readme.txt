ToyRobot 

1. This solution has been developed as a .net core console application using the C# language in Visual 2019 community edition IDE
2. To run the application, open the ToyRobot.sln file in Visual Studio
3. There are 2 projects in the solution - ToyRobot & ToyRobotTests
4. ToyRobot contains the code to solve the challenge
5. ToyRobotTests contains a bunch of tests to validate the requirements. The NUnit test framework is required to run these tests.

Thank you.
